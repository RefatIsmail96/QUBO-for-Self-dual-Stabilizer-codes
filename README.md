# Finding Self-dual Stabilizer code distance using QUBO approach
This program constructs a QUBO cost function whose minimization corresponds to finding the Hamming distance of a Stabilizer code. Solving the minimization problem can then be done using classical algorithms like Simulated Annealing (SA) or quantum ones like Quantum Annealing (QA) or using hybrid approaches, ex QBsolv. More details can be found in this paper (link will soon be posted on arxiv) along with an investigation into the efficiency of the three approaches. This code was written in collaboration between ([@Refat Ismail](https://github.com/RefatIsmail96)) and ([@Ashish Kakkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishkakkar21/)).

# Working with code
The code shows how to construct the QUBO and solve it on Neal's Simulated Annealing. It can be easily adjusted to run on other platforms depending on the user's purpose.
