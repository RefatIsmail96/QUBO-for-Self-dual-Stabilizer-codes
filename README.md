# Stabilizer-code-distance
This program constructs a QUBO cost function whose minimization corresponds to finding the Hamming distance of a Stabillizer code. Solving the minimzation problem can then be done using classical algorithims like Simulated Annealing (SA) or quantum ones like Quantum Annealing (QA) or using hybrid approaches, ex QBsolv. More details can be found in this paper (link will soon be posted on arxiv) along with an investigation into the effeciency of the three approaches. This code was written in collaboration between ([@Refat Ismail](https://github.com/RefatIsmail96)) and ([@Ashish Kakkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishkakkar21/)).
